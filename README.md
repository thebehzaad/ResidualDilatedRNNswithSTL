# Time Series Forecasting Using Joint STL Decomposition and Residual Dilated RNNs

PyTorch Implementation of joint STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) decomposition and Residual Dilated RNNs for time series forecasting. 

## Dataset

 * M4 competition dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M4-methods/tree/master/Dataset)

 * For more information about the M4 competition, look at [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207018300785)

## Acknowledgments

This implementation is based on the PyTorch implementation of ES-RNN by damitkwr ([Github Page](https://github.com/damitkwr)), and Dilated RNNs by Zalando Research ([Github Page](https://github.com/zalandoresearch)).
