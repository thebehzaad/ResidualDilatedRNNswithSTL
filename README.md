# Time Series Forecasting Using Residual Dilated RNNs with STL Decomposition

PyTorch Implementation of Residual Dilated RNNs with STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) decomposition

## Dataset

 * M4 competition dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M4-methods/tree/master/Dataset)

 * For more information about the M4 competition, look at [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169207018300785)

## Acknowledgments

This implementation is based on the PyTorch implementation of ES-RNN by damitkwr ([Github Page](https://github.com/damitkwr)), and Dilated RNNs by Zalando Research ([Github Page](https://github.com/zalandoresearch)).
